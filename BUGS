1) There is a free() error still to be fixed on FreeBSD alpha 
   cdy (cyarnell@warped.com) and I have been working on it *sigh* slowly.

   I suspect it is fixed now with v0.3.6 as it was likely the same bug
   as the Linux bug. Freeing an already free()' struct.
   please let me know someone.

2) I suspect strtol() for any DCC connect would not work period. let me know.
   (look in serverif.c for DCC connect code) I've changed it to use
   strtoul() for SOLARIS I suspect it should just be that way for all OS's.

tcm-hybrid known bugs

1) Opers with spoofed hostnames issuing PRIVMSG tcm .chat, to have the TCM
   initiate the DCC connection, require both the spoofed hostname and the
   real hostname in the TCM O: lines, or else when the user issues .register,
   TCM will core.  The reason why is still a mystery to us
