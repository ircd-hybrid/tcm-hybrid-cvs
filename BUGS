1) There is a free() error still to be fixed on freebsd alpha 
   cdy (cyarnell@warped.com) and I have been working on it *sigh* slowly.

   I suspect it is fixed now with v0.3.6 as it was likely the same bug
   as the linux bug. Freeing an already free()' struct.
   please let me know someone.

2) I suspect strtol() for any DCC connect would not work period. let me know.
   (look in serverif.c for DCC connect code) I've changed it to use
   strtoul() for SOLARIS I suspect it should just be that way for all OS's.
