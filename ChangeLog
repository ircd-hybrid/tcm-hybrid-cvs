Misc. documentation updates
Release version 2.5.2, as a number of things have been done since 2.5.1
release


*** 20010203_2 by wcampbel
Format string bugs...
We must find out what that 0 byte log file bug is...even if it means
ripping out the mail code...


*** 20010203_1 by wcampbel
Massive cleanup part 4 of 4.  tcm compiles cleanly (except for the version
variables) with -Wall -Wunused...... and SHOULD be pretty clean now.  I'll
run it through lint soon, then will start going through and cleaning up the
rest of the code.  We'll see how it goes...

Oh, I forgot to mention I added usermode +l to the MODE command it sends to
the server when it connects.  This allows tcm to see LOCOPS messages when
it is run against a Hybrid 7 server.
