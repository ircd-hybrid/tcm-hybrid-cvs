*** 20010723_1 by wcampbel
Replace all sprintf's with more secure snprintf's

Directory /usr/cvsroot/tcm-hybrid/bin added to the repository


*** 20010722_7 by wcampbel
Made tcm work with getopt for command line arguments.

They will have to use ./tcm -f conf.file or just use the standard tcm.cf
name.


*** 20010722_6 by wcampbel
Keep all logs in the logs/ directory.

This is the code to support the help files in a subdirectory.
The repo-move will be done as soon as I finish this commit


*** 20010721_2 by wcampbel
I did a repo-move for the *.h files into include/
This is what else needed to be done to make it work...
Next is the icky src files...

- Solaris uses mblk_t from sys/stream.h for sys/socketvar.h; i've added
  necessary tests and includes in source to fix compile


*** 20010617_1 by jdc
- bothunt.c, logging.c: Linux needs time.h (patch by Hwy).


*** 20010614_1 by db
- just upped version



*** 20010603_3 by db
patch sent in by Walter Campbell
1.  Document that USE_CRYPT is enabled by default
2.  Fix an issue where people could telnet to the tcm and not type
    anything.  Those people would see everything that an oper would.
    I changed it so that sensitive data is only sent to remote TCM's
    if they were NOT pending connections (meaning fully registered)

Simple change of -1 to INVALID for consistency -db



*** 20010603_2 by greg
Two simple bugfixes.

- (from Walter Campbell) oper before doing a /stats O; some servers may
  make use of OLINES_OPER_ONLY, or similar.
- (pointed out by KrON/ogre) fixed a nifty core where islegal_pass() fell
  off the edge of the userlist array.

(hum, maybe we should do something when spoofed opers msg the bot .chat?
I can see this being a) an information leak if tcm is not opers_only, and
b) a problem when a person uses .chat, but their oline is for their spoof)


*** 20010603_1 by db
Submitted by Walter Campbell <wcampbel@botbay.net>

My "commit" message:

1.  Makes numerous commands that can give away information oper only
2.  The oper only conf line is in tcm.cf, not userlist.cf
3.  FLAGS on comstud servers was missing a +
4.  Documentation cleanup
5.  fixed a couple compiler errors when wingate checking is enabled
6.  Fixed another small issue with the opers only option
7.  Added a small piece of debug code to the tcm.cf conf parser
8.  Fixed a MAJOR security hole in .action

The 1st and 8th are big, and in my opinion should warrant a new
release, with whatever bug fixes greg decides to throw in.



*** 20010602_2 by greg
.. this one got missed.

- FLAGS +SOME +UNGODLY +NUMBER +OF +INDIVIDUAL +FLAGS -> FLAGS +ALL
  (ircd-comstud compat.)


*** 20010602_1 by greg
Well kids, my first CVS commit. Be afraid or something.

Some cleanup before I do some in-depth stuff.
- removed the capability to msg a tcm .clones, it's kind of
  silly considering we dump it to the channel and stuff.
- removed a few extraneous msg_mychannel()'s that were randomly
  dumping "  [etc.]" to the TCM's channel, and personally scaring
  the hell out of me when I randomly see my TCM speak.

Build check done.


*** 20010403_2 by db
- corrected drone code to honour autopilot as well
- corrected examples.



*** 20010403_1 by db
- removed extra print to opers about cfloods
- fixed spam warning to suggest .kspam



*** 20010402_2 by db
- action must specifically say "warn" or no warning is given at all



*** 20010402_1 by db
- cleaned up the logging, no more 0 length log files
- renamed clone_log to just log, its a generic log
- re-added back autopilot
- added new tcm.cf flag "D" for deny i.e. opers only
- oper deny /dcc will not show ip any more of tcm
- bumped version up
- tested on irc.ins.net.uk

Misc. documentation updates
Release version 2.5.2, as a number of things have been done since 2.5.1
release


*** 20010203_2 by wcampbel
Format string bugs...
We must find out what that 0 byte log file bug is...even if it means
ripping out the mail code...


*** 20010203_1 by wcampbel
Massive cleanup part 4 of 4.  tcm compiles cleanly (except for the version
variables) with -Wall -Wunused...... and SHOULD be pretty clean now.  I'll
run it through lint soon, then will start going through and cleaning up the
rest of the code.  We'll see how it goes...

Oh, I forgot to mention I added usermode +l to the MODE command it sends to
the server when it connects.  This allows tcm to see LOCOPS messages when
it is run against a Hybrid 7 server.


*** 20010202_1 by wcampbel
Massive cleanup part 3
