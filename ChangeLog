  Removed .k<actionname> and made .kaction as a generic dcc command for

  handle_action retrieves ips on demand, and reverts from d-line to k-line
  if an ip couldn't be found.
  
  STATS I wont show spoofed I-lines, so all oper hosts from stats O get added
  as exempts instead.
  
  vclone is back to the logic it had before when it comes to masking hosts.

  Log:
  Major action handling changes.
  
  suggest_action and suggest_host are gone, handle_action replaces them.
  
  handle_action does all reporting to irc/dcc, thus some reporting have
  been removed from misc files. A new action field is used by handle_action
  to perform user/host modifications before sending k-lines.
  IPs are passed to handle_action, in case configured handling method should
  be dline, this does *not work properly now*. Will be fixed soon.
  
  actions now are dynamically allocated, and have some changed fields.
  .action is redone
  .save works
  exempts should work
  Config changes for actions, see tcm.cf
  
  dlopen now uses RTLD_GLOBAL, as the modules depend on each other anyway.

*** 20011017_4 by wcampbel
Correction, that was .restart, not .rehash


*** 20011017_3 by wcampbel
Added .restart.  It works but does not properly clean up connections.
  Someone who knows current tcm code better will need to handle this.
Removed the less than polite Makefile.  There is no reason for it...
  If people cannot run ./configure, they shouldn't be running the service
  in the first place.  This Makefile also interferes with cvs update's and
  commits if you don't make distclean first.


*** 20011017_2 by wcampbel
Doc cleanups
Minor cosmetic code cleanups
configure now takes the current working directory and sets it to DPATH, this
  is used when starting so that it chdir's into there BEFORE trying to use
  the conf files.  This will allow the tcm to be started from any directory,
  not just in the root of the source tree.  The side effect is that users
  will have to build in place...they cannot build then move the tree elsewhere.
  This will also be used for RESTART.


*** 20011017_1 by bill

- whoop, first in what is sure to be series of typo fixes (argv[9] needed where argv[6] was)


*** 20011016_2 by bill
- got rid of tcm linking userlist flags
  (note: once and for all, tcm link support is *gone*)
  it needs to be rewritten, and taking it out was motivation for me to redo it
- replaced old E: lines in userlist.cf with what were once known as F: lines
- updated connection flooding to handle "Invalid username" notices as well as
  X-line rejection notices
- added capability to detect network splits/joins and inform SEND_WARN_ONLY users
- added G-line support (for monitoring, I have yet to decide if tcm opers should have control over
  voting on G-lines)
- REHASH notice still doesn't seem to work.  I have absolutely no idea why.. anyone?
- added logging of "Failed OPER attempt" notices, also inform SEND_WARN_ONLY users
- added logging of "has just acquired the personality of a ..." notices, and again, inform
  SEND_WARN_ONLY users
- rewrote okhost() to be action specific; the rules are as follows:
   cflood  -- ident -> ident@host          no ident -> ~*@host
   vclone  -- ident -> ident@ip.block.0/24 no ident -> ~*@ip.block.0/24
   flood   -- ident -> ident@*.domain      no ident -> ~*@host
   link    -- ident -> ident@host          no ident -> ~*@host
   bot     -- ident -> ident@*.domain      no ident -> ~*@host
   ctcp    -- ident -> ident@*.domain      no ident -> ~*@host
   spambot -- ident -> ident@*.domain      no ident -> ~*@host
   clone   -- ident -> *@host              no ident -> ~*@host
   sclone  -- ident -> *@host              no ident -> ~*@host
   drone   -- ident -> *@host              no ident -> ~*@host
   wingate -- ident -> *@host              no ident -> ~*@host
   socks   -- ident -> *@host              no ident -> ~*@host
    (note: I would like these to be, at some point, #define'able or even better, configurable
           in the config file(s).  Dynamic configuration, like .action, would be the next step
           to this, too.)


*** 20011016_1 by bill
- first step of major comit -- updated to correct action names
                            -- updated user flags (and added +e/+p to userlist)


*** 20011013_4 by bill
- document updates
- connection flooders always klined ident@<whatever> even if there is no ident


*** 20011013_3 by bill
- stat() caused core.  to hell with it.


*** 20011013_2 by bill
- changed around .vbots and .vmulti to maintain format of .bots and .hmulti

- first commit towards modularization
  note: this tcm does *not* work, and yes I know it compiles

TODO:
  I need to finish updating the files in modules/ to work as (un)loadable
  modules, and to work independently of one another.

*** 20010722_7 by wcampbel
Made tcm work with getopt for command line arguments.

name.

The repo-move will be done as soon as I finish this commit

I did a repo-move for the *.h files into include/
This is what else needed to be done to make it work...
Next is the icky src files...

Add a few more bugs to the BUGS list
Add a check for crypt.h, needed for some (lame) Linux distributions

  necessary tests and includes in source to fix compile

- bothunt.c, logging.c: Linux needs time.h (patch by Hwy).


*** 20010614_1 by db
- just upped version

patch sent in by W. Campbell
1.  Document that USE_CRYPT is enabled by default
2.  Fix an issue where people could telnet to the tcm and not type
    anything.  Those people would see everything that an oper would.
    I changed it so that sensitive data is only sent to remote TCM's
    if they were NOT pending connections (meaning fully registered)

Simple change of -1 to INVALID for consistency -db

Two simple bugfixes.

- (from W. Campbell) oper before doing a /stats O; some servers may
  make use of OLINES_OPER_ONLY, or similar.
- (pointed out by KrON/ogre) fixed a nifty core where islegal_pass() fell
  off the edge of the userlist array.

(hum, maybe we should do something when spoofed opers msg the bot .chat?
I can see this being a) an information leak if tcm is not opers_only, and
b) a problem when a person uses .chat, but their oline is for their spoof)

Submitted by W. Campbell <wcampbel@botbay.net>

My "commit" message:

1.  Makes numerous commands that can give away information oper only
2.  The oper only conf line is in tcm.cf, not userlist.cf
3.  FLAGS on comstud servers was missing a +
4.  Documentation cleanup
5.  fixed a couple compiler errors when wingate checking is enabled
6.  Fixed another small issue with the opers only option
7.  Added a small piece of debug code to the tcm.cf conf parser
8.  Fixed a MAJOR security hole in .action

The 1st and 8th are big, and in my opinion should warrant a new
release, with whatever bug fixes greg decides to throw in.

.. this one got missed.

- FLAGS +SOME +UNGODLY +NUMBER +OF +INDIVIDUAL +FLAGS -> FLAGS +ALL
  (ircd-comstud compat.)

Well kids, my first CVS commit. Be afraid or something.

Some cleanup before I do some in-depth stuff.
- removed the capability to msg a tcm .clones, it's kind of
  silly considering we dump it to the channel and stuff.
- removed a few extraneous msg_mychannel()'s that were randomly
  dumping "  [etc.]" to the TCM's channel, and personally scaring
  the hell out of me when I randomly see my TCM speak.

Build check done.

- corrected drone code to honour autopilot as well
- corrected examples.



*** 20010403_1 by db

*** 20010402_2 by db

- renamed clone_log to just log, its a generic log

Misc. documentation updates
Release version 2.5.2, as a number of things have been done since 2.5.1
release


*** 20010203_2 by wcampbel
Format string bugs...
We must find out what that 0 byte log file bug is...even if it means
ripping out the mail code...


*** 20010203_1 by wcampbel
Massive cleanup part 4 of 4.  tcm compiles cleanly (except for the version
variables) with -Wall -Wunused...... and SHOULD be pretty clean now.  I'll
run it through lint soon, then will start going through and cleaning up the
rest of the code.  We'll see how it goes...

Oh, I forgot to mention I added usermode +l to the MODE command it sends to
the server when it connects.  This allows tcm to see LOCOPS messages when
it is run against a Hybrid 7 server.
