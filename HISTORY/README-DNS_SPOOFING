tcm v0.4.3 now has code to try and detect some of the dns spoofers
we are getting

From the config.h file:

/* PLEASE note, when the dns spoofers discover tcm is verifying hosts
   They will also go after the tcm host... *shrug* but maybe we can
   keep them busy for a while eh? - Dianora
*/

There are three mechanisms it uses.. 

It will use WHOIP (avaiable on some non standard versions of CSr29)
if available...(I have such a version - Dianora)

It will use USRIP (available on th+hybrid)

and default to use STATS L if either of the two above are not available

You must have DETECT_DNS_SPOOFERS defined for any of the above to work
check config.h

There is also still top level domain TLD checking still in the code,
you can have tcm auto kill a bogus TLD right off. 

Of course, using STATS L on every connect will flood opers 
pretty darn well... sooooo da5id (William Rockwood wjr@wwa.com)
came up with this quick and dirty solution for ircii clients...
(no, I don't have one for mirc...)

^server_notice "* notice -- stats L requested by % (user@host)"

stick the user@host of the tcm into the above, load and be happy.

For example, I found this worked for me, with my test tcm
and stock ircii 2.9 client
 
 /on ^server "* Notice -- STATS L requested by % (db@*ottawa.net)*"
