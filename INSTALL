Quick install guide for tcm-hybrid3.1

  To install into a directory other than the compile directory, you 
must run ./configure --prefix with the pathname following.  Example:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ircd/tcm

  Read the config.h file. Its pretty self explanatory... the defaults
should be fine to start. If you want to play with these settings,
this is all handled from the tcm.cf now. Read the .html docs which
are also online at http://www.ircd-hybrid.org/tcm/tcm.html

  The biggies are the etc/tcm.cf and etc/userlist.cf files.  Please see
the provided files for more information.
