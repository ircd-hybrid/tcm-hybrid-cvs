Quick install guide for tcm-hybrid3.0

IMPORTANT:  Since the configure script sets the path that it is run in as
            DPATH, you MUST configure tcm in the place that it will run.

  Read the config.h file. Its pretty self explanatory... the defaults
should be fine to start. If you want to play with AUTO_KLINE etc.
this is all handled from the tcm.cf now. Read the .html docs which
are also online at http://www.ircd-hybrid.org/tcm/tcm.html

  The biggies are the etc/tcm.cf and etc/userlist.cf files.  Please see
the provided files for more information.
