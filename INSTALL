quickly install guide for tcm-hybrid2.5

  Run the configure script

  Read the config.h file. Its pretty self explanatory... the defaults
should be fine to start. If you want to play with AUTO_KLINE etc.
this is all handled from the tcm.cf now. Read the .html docs which
are also online at http://www.db.net/~db/tcm.html

  The biggie is the etc/tcm.cf file Its pretty straight forward

# Username for the tcm
U:db
# virtual host name if needed
V:irc.frizzle.org
# O line for the bot with password
O:dianora:noway
# Server for the bot
S:irc.frizzle.net:6666
# Nick for the bot
N:mobot
# Bot's IRCNAME
I:irc.frizzle.net connection monitor bot
# channel for the bot
C:&frizzle.net
#
## These set the actions the tcm will take on various conditions
## this negates the need to configure quite a bit in config.h
## These actions will be overriden by the ones set in tcm.pref
## which can be written to using .save You can also .load tcm.pref
## but tcm.pref is automatically read after tcm.cf at startup.
#
