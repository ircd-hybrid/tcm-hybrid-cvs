Quick install guide for tcm-hybrid3.0

  To install into a directory other than the compile directory, you 
must run ./configure --prefix with the pathname following.  Example:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ircd/tcm

WARNING:  If you are running this on the same box as an ircd-hybrid-7
          server, do NOT make the tcm prefix the same as the ircd prefix.
          This is due to the fact that tcm and hybrid-7 use the same
          directories and extensions for their modules.  Hybrid-7 and tcm
          would not be able to distinguish between their respective
          modules.

  Read the config.h file. Its pretty self explanatory... the defaults
should be fine to start. If you want to play with AUTO_KLINE etc.
this is all handled from the tcm.cf now. Read the .html docs which
are also online at http://www.ircd-hybrid.org/tcm/tcm.html

  The biggies are the etc/tcm.cf and etc/userlist.cf files.  Please see
the provided files for more information.
