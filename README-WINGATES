  This tcm has two methods of detecting open wingates. One is the
class open port 1080. This will catch wingates as well as open proxies..
Unfortunately, it will not detect an open busy wingate!
I discovered in testing that when a microsoft wingate is full, it
stops replying to all port 1080 connects. They get away with it if
you only check port 1080. However, they continue to still be open on port 23.
That leaves us with a bit of a problem. The observant will note that port
23 is the telnet port. If you hit port 23 on shell boxes, they tend
to get very upset.

  You can reduce the risk of annoying shell boxes by limiting your
probes to port 23 to I lines that match *ppp* or *slip* or.. 
This is possible in tcm-hybrid by putting your *ppp* etc. into a single
"dialup class" and having tcm only probe port 23 with connects in this class.
This is done with the new key letter 'W".

  If you have "W:class" in userlist.cf, you can set a class to test for wingate
i.e. you can set it up to only wingate test class 9, and set up
matching I lines to only test "suspicious" sites such as *ppp* etc.
not testing shell boxes.
