tcm v0.4.4b4 now has code to try and catch open wingates...

  Look in config.h for DETECT_WINGATE

#define AUTO_KLINE_WINGATES
#define KLINE_WINGATE "KLINE 60"
#define KLINE_WINGATE_REASON "Open_wingate"

  Since this code sets up a reverse connection to the connecting
client host, I would suggest a disclaimer in the motd
"This server reserves the right to check for open wingates"
or some such.

  The DALNET anti wingate patch simply checks for port 1080 allowing
a connection. Guess what? I found that 1080 is not listened to
on busy wingate. i.e. The wingate is on your server already,
and port 1080 is turned off at that time. I had to connect to port 23
to check. When a wingate is not busy, you will get "WinGate>"
if it is busy, you will get "Too many connected users - try again later"
and you get disconnected. This code looks for both "WinGate>"
and the busy message.


  I've added the new key "W" to userlist.cf
  If you have "W:class" you can set a class to test for wingate
i.e. you can set it up to only wingate test class 9, and set up
matching I lines to only test "suspicious" sites such as *ppp* etc.
not testing shell boxes.
