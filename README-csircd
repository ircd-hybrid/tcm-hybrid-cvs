Special operating instructions for csircd:
In order for tcm to work properly on csircd-1.13, a client's ip address
must be part of the TRACE output.  A patch for csircd is included with
this package in the tools/ directory

You *must* have the following variables set:
SET CLIENTCONNECT YES
SET SHOW_NICKCHANGES YES

The tcm should have the following flags in its oper {} block:
cankline;
canflood;
canlocalkill;

It should optionally have:
cangline;	This will enable .gline (assuming its defined)

Note: If you give it the "local" flag, it will not be able to communicate
      with efnet's services completely.  Specifically, it will not be able
      to issue the "drones" command
