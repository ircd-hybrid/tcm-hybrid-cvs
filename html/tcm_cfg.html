How to set up a tcm configuration file
</H2>
<P>
The tcm.cf file is the heart of the tcm, unlike early early
versions of tcm, server nick etc. are not compiled into the tcm itself.
This allows the ability to use the same binary on more than one server

<P> tcm will only test for wingate/socks if it is in one of these
listed classes, as set in W lines. i.e. Set up a class that only
matches *ppp* connects, and set up the W line to only test connections
in that class.
