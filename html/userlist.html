How to set up a tcm userlist.cf file
</H2>
<P>
Here is the sample userlist.cf file in the distribution
</P>
<PRE>
#
# userlist.cf file
#
# each line is colon separated
#
# C: line is for remote connecting tcm only, same format as
# O: line but B flag is already implied by C:
# B: line is a banned user from dcc chat to the tcm
#
# O line format:
# O:hostmask:nick:password:flags
#
# Passwords can be encrypted ONLY if USE_CRYPT has been defined
# use the mkpass utility from the tools/ directory to encrypt
# a password.
#
#
# Flags - privs are O for oper, K for kline/kill/etc
# B for remote tcm, G for gline privilege for a user
# if a remote tcm is missing a 'K' then gline requests will not
# be honoured from that tcm.
#
# added some flags here..
#   +/-M will give the user the ability to set dynamic flags for other users
#   +/-I will, if set, override the dyanmic i flag
#   +/-D will give this user access to .dline
#   +/-s will allow this user to see STAT requests made by users
#   +/-w will show this user misc. warnings, such as clones detected and
#         the like
#   +/-i will make this user invisible to the list of tcm opers connected
#         to our bot in a STATS p reply (this is only used if INVISIBLE_OPERS
#         is defined)
#   +/-l will show this user link requests, both incoming and outgoing
#   +/-m will show this user MOTD requests
#   +/-o will show this user LOCOPs
#
#               -bill 5/2000
#
# Remember, remote opers will not be able to remote kline etc.
# until they ".register password" with the password as given here.
#
# allow lametcm to connect to us as a remote linked tcm
# allow it oper and kline privs.
#
O:*.yoursite.com:lametcm:notrealpassword:okb
#
# or equivalently...
# note, the 'b' flag from above is implicit in an N line
#
N:*.yoursite.com:lametcm:notrealpassword:ok
</PRE>
<P>
This one is asked the most often of me,
as far as a tcm is concerned, a remote tcm is just a special form of 
remote oper. Because admins are familiar with C/N convention of ircd
an N line is just a way of clearly distinguishing your remote 
tcm's from your remote opers. It also saves you one extra letter.
Other than that, an N line is identical to an O line with a B/T flag.

#
# db@*db.net has oper remote kline and gline privs
#
O:db@*.db.net:-DCC-:notrealpassword:okg
#
# pro@*.parodius.com has oper remote kline gline and is invisible to irc users
#
O:pro@*.parodius.com:pro:notrealpassword:OKGi                 
#
# db@*bsd.org has oper and remote kline but no gline privs
#
O:db@*bsd.org:-DCC-:notrealpassword:ok
#
#
# Exceptions to kline and kill actions by tcm
# tcm will also read the E lines from the ircd.conf file
# by doing a stats E
#
E:db@*.db.net
E:*@*varner.com
#
#
# C: lines
# tcm's we know about
# each entry here consists of a colon separated line
#
# hostname where remote tcm is running
# default nickname of remote tcm
# password and port
#
C:your.tcm.site.com:lametcm:nottherealpassword:6800
#
# ignore these users if they try to do a /dcc chat
B:loser@*lamesite.com
</PRE>
<P> tcm will not allow anyone who is in the .ban list, which is set here,
to /dcc chat the tcm. This is not necessary if your tcm is set up
for OPER_ONLY when you compiled it (config.h)
